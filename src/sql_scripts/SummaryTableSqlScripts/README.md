# Scripts for Overall Summary

This folder lists all scripts used to create the project summary table at the start of the replication
paper.  The spreadsheet Table1SqlScript.ods (open office format) lists which script was used to which
row and column of the table.

The script run_all.sh will produce the tables values from left to right, top to bottom. It takes one
argument, the name of the database being queried.
