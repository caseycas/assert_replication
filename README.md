# Script and Data Storage

This repository contains the set of our sql, r, and java scripts
used in the replication of our paper Assert Use in GitHub Projects
from ICSE 2015.

It also contains the extracted tables from our git log parse.

The project logs parsed are too big to store on GitHub, but are
available on request from: ccasal@ucdavis.edu or caseycasal@gmail.com

The file ReplicationSteps.txt contains the steps needed to unpack the
data and reproduce the results in our replication set.
